# Bluetooth_USART
STM32F429 BT Demo
By Eric Yu

Special thanks to http://stm32f4-discovery.com/ and Tilen Majerle for his awesome library dedicated to teaching and learning more about the STM32F4 discovery boards.

The Bluetooth_USART project is a culmination of minor projects all in one. It features the LCD display, servo drivers, distance sensors, all controlled via bluetooth.

Current Functions:

  * Turning on/off LEDS
  
  * Controlling rotation of servo's from 0-180 degrees (SG90 servo modules)
  
  * Output Distance onto Display (HC_SR04 modules)
  
  * BT communication (HC-05 module)

Future Functions:

  * Output GPS coordinates (Sparkfun Venus GPS)
  
  * Control DC motors
